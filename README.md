The output is a JSON file with an .vsext file extension looking like this:

```json
{
  "id": "a5952e33-576b-44cf-af5b-466cb6d0ca50",
  "name": "My Visual Studio extensions",
  "description": "A collection of my Visual Studio extensions",
  "version": "1.0",
  "extensions": [
    {
      "name": "Extensibility Tools",
      "vsixId": "f8330d54-0469-43a7-8fc0-7f19febeb897"
    },
    {
      "name": "Web Essentials 2017",
      "vsixId": "bb7e2273-9a70-4e5e-b4dd-1f361b6166c0"
    },
    {
      "name": "EditorConfig Language Service",
      "vsixId": "1209461d-57f8-46a4-814a-dbe5fecef941"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Import
Clicking the import button prompts you to select a .vsext file. Doing that will present you with this dialog that lists all the extensions found in the .vsext file.

Before showing the list it will verify that the extensions exist on the Marketplace and that can take a few seconds.

Clicking the **Select** button in the dialog will start the VSIX Installer in a separate process and you can follow the normal install flow from there.

## Manage solution extensions
This allows you to specify which extensions needed to work on any given solution. When a developer opens the solution and doesn't have one or more of the extensions installed, they are prompted to install them.

Right-click the solution to manage the extensions.

![Context menu](art/context-menu.png)

This will show this dialog where you can pick wich of your extensions to associate with the solution.

When clicking **Select** a .vsext file will be created and placed next to the solution file (.sln). You should commit the generated .vsext file to souce control.
